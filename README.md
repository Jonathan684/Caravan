## Analog Chip

The following project implements an analog circuit from which we want to extract samples with digital circuits, for example, schim triger, and then a counter so that they are later analyzed in the riscV. The riscV can then send the data to the outside of the chip by using the UART.

:warning: | Use this sample project for analog user projects. 

Refer to [README](docs/source/index.rst) for this sample project documentation.
